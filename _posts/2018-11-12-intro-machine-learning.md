The main idea of this blog is for me to share what I am learning with you. A place for me to try and bring together concepts and write them down as a complete thought.  Maybe I might be able to shed some light on a subject for you, or maybe you might be inclined to let me know if I got something wrong and point me in the right direction, that would be pretty rad.

I'm new to blogging, machine learning, and web development.  There are going to be some growing pains, so bear with me.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ml4me_io) or email <me@machinelearning4me.io>.

Best Regards!
